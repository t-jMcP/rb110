1. Initialise a variable `lights` to reference a hash with its keys as every number between 1 and `n` and each value as `'false'`
2. For each `num` from `1` to `n`
   1. For each `light` in `lights`
      1. If `light`â€™s key is a multiple of `num`, convert its value to its boolean opposite
3. For each `light` in `lights`
   1. Add its key to a new array `on_lights` if its value is `true`
